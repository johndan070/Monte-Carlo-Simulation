# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation that simulates photons going through a material getting scattered, absorbed and reflected.
To see the output of the simulation, run the program and open "out.png" with an image-editing software such as gimp, or if you can't run the program, just download the image file straight from the repository.
